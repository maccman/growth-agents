# Git Auto-Commit After Significant Work

After completing any of the following, **always create a git commit and push it**:

- Running or completing a script (data processing, enrichment, analysis, etc.)
- Writing or modifying scripts in `scripts/`
- Generating or updating files in `data/`
- Any meaningful change to `lib/`, `types/`, or config files
- Completing a multi-step agent task

## Commit Workflow

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<concise description of what was done>"
git push
```

## Commit Message Style

- Use present tense, imperative: "Add lead enrichment script", "Generate SEO report for acme.com"
- Be specific: mention the script name, data file, or task completed
- Keep it under 72 characters

## When NOT to Commit

- Mid-task when work is incomplete or broken
- After trivial clarifications or read-only exploration
- If the user explicitly says not to

The commit should happen automatically at the end of each meaningful unit of work — don't wait to be asked.

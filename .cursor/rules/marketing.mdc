# Marketing Domain Knowledge

## Key Metrics & Formulas

When calculating marketing metrics, use these standard definitions:

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total sales & marketing spend / Number of new customers acquired
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Average revenue per customer × Average customer lifespan (or ARPU / churn rate for subscription businesses)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: LTV / CAC (healthy = 3:1 or higher)
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Revenue from ads / Ad spend (break-even = 1.0)
- **CPC (Cost Per Click)**: Ad spend / Number of clicks
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**: (Ad spend / Impressions) × 1000
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Clicks / Impressions × 100
- **Conversion Rate**: Conversions / Total visitors (or clicks) × 100
- **MQL → SQL Conversion**: SQLs / MQLs × 100
- **Churn Rate**: Customers lost in period / Customers at start of period × 100
- **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)**: (Starting MRR + expansion − contraction − churn) / Starting MRR × 100
- **Payback Period**: CAC / (ARPU × Gross margin)

## SEO Audits

When performing SEO audits, check for:

**Technical SEO**

- Title tags (present, unique, 50-60 chars)
- Meta descriptions (present, unique, 150-160 chars)
- H1 tags (exactly one per page)
- Image alt text
- Canonical tags
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- Page speed / Core Web Vitals
- Mobile responsiveness
- HTTPS
- Broken links (internal and external)
- Structured data / schema markup

**On-Page SEO**

- Keyword placement (title, H1, first 100 words, URL)
- Internal linking structure
- Content length and depth relative to competitors
- URL structure (short, descriptive, hyphenated)

**Content Quality Signals**

- Originality
- E-E-A-T signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Freshness / last updated date
- Multimedia (images, videos, infographics)

## Email Marketing Best Practices

When generating email content:

- Subject lines: 6-10 words, frontload the value prop, avoid spam triggers (FREE, !!!, ALL CAPS)
- Preview text: Complement the subject line (don't repeat it), 40-130 chars
- Body: One clear CTA per email, scannable with short paragraphs, personalization tokens where appropriate
- Plain text version should always accompany HTML
- Unsubscribe link is legally required (CAN-SPAM, GDPR)

**Email sequence pacing:**

- Welcome/onboarding: Day 0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14
- Nurture: Weekly or biweekly cadence
- Re-engagement: After 30/60/90 days of inactivity

## Lead Enrichment

When enriching lead data, common fields to add:

- Company name, domain, size (employee count), industry, location
- LinkedIn profile URL
- Job title normalization and seniority level
- Tech stack (via BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, or similar)
- Funding stage and amount (for startups)
- Social profiles

Always preserve original data — add new columns, never overwrite source columns.

## Ad Copy

When generating ad copy:

**Google Ads (Search)**

- Headlines: Up to 30 characters each, 15 headlines max
- Descriptions: Up to 90 characters each, 4 descriptions max
- Include keywords, CTAs, and unique selling points
- Use title case for headlines

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**

- Primary text: 125 characters visible before "See More"
- Headline: 27 characters visible
- Description: 27 characters visible
- Focus on pain points and outcomes, not features

**LinkedIn**

- Introductory text: 150 characters visible before "See More"
- Keep professional but not stiff
- Lead with data or insights

## A/B Testing

When analyzing A/B test results:

- Minimum sample size before drawing conclusions (use power analysis)
- Calculate p-value — declare significance at p < 0.05
- Report confidence intervals, not just point estimates
- Watch for novelty effects (new variants often win initially then regress)
- Segment results by meaningful dimensions (device, traffic source, user type)
- Check for Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) before trusting results

## Competitive Analysis

When researching competitors, structure the output as:

1. **Overview**: Company, founding year, funding, team size, target market
2. **Product**: Core features, pricing model, free tier, integrations
3. **Positioning**: Tagline, value proposition, key differentiators
4. **Content & SEO**: Blog cadence, top-ranking pages, domain authority
5. **Social presence**: Channels, follower counts, posting cadence, engagement
6. **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Relative to the user's product

## Funnel Analysis

Standard funnel stages for SaaS:

1. **Awareness**: Impressions, reach, website visits
2. **Interest**: Signups, email subscribers, content downloads
3. **Consideration**: Product trials, demo requests, pricing page views
4. **Conversion**: Paid customers, plan selection
5. **Retention**: Active usage, renewal, expansion
6. **Referral**: NPS, referral program participation, reviews

When analyzing funnels, always calculate stage-to-stage conversion rates and identify the biggest drop-off points.

## Cohort Analysis

When building retention cohort tables:

- Rows = cohort (grouped by signup week/month)
- Columns = time periods since signup (Week 0, Week 1, ..., or Month 0, Month 1, ...)
- Cells = % of cohort still active in that period
- Always include the cohort size (N) in the first column
- Highlight trends: improving, declining, or stable retention over time

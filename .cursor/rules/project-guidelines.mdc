# Growth Agents - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a marketing ops and growth automation playground powered by Cursor AI. Agents are designed to perform complex, multi-step marketing tasks including lead enrichment, SEO audits, campaign analysis, content generation, competitive intelligence, and reporting.

Users interact with agents through Cursor's Chat to direct marketing tasks.

Assume users are non-technical marketing ops and growth leaders. Be friendly, skip jargon, and never ask them to run terminal commands or choose a programming language — just handle it.

## Agent Development Process

1. **Planning First**: Always come up with a good plan before executing any task. You MUST get sign off on the plan from the user before continuing.
2. **Write and run typescript or python code**: Write and run typescript/python code to test your ideas. For anything that is best done programmatically, like math or other types of logic, then just write a quick TypeScript/python program and run it.
3. **ALWAYS prefer running executables vs writing scripts**: Running executables is faster than writing scripts.
4. **Data from the web**: Use the `web_search` and `mcp_browsermcp` tools to get data from the web. Never use the `mcp_browsermcp` tool to Google search - you should use the dedicated `web_search` tool for that as it's more reliable.
5. **Use unix principles**: Use unix principles to build your scripts. Use `stdin` and `stdout`. Use `|` to chain commands together.
6. **Stream output**: Stream output to the console. e.g. when processing CSVs, output line by line.
7. **Never alter a file in the `data/` directory in-place**: Always either produce a copy or, if you're editing textual data, use `stdin` and `stdout` to edit the data.

## AI SDK

To communicate with AI providers, use the Vercel AI SDK.

- **Use Vercel AI SDK**: Use the AI SDK directly with providers like `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`
- **No Custom Abstractions**: Don't create custom AI client wrappers - use the SDK directly
- Environment variables for AI providers are automatically handled by Vercel AI SDK
- No need to manually check or validate API keys in code
- Standard variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`

## Project Structure

- `lib/` - Reusable utilities and shared code
- `scripts/` - Runnable task scripts (use tsx for execution)
- `types/` - Shared TypeScript type definitions
- `data/` - Storage for data files (CSV exports, lead lists, campaign data, reports)

## Package Management

- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Always use `pnpm` for package management
- **Python**: Always use `uv` for package management (10-100x faster than pip)
- Run TypeScript scripts with `pnpm start scripts/script_name.ts`
- Run Python scripts with `uv run scripts/script_name.py`

## Data Storage Guidelines

- Use **Markdown** for reports, briefs, and documentation
- Use **CSV** for tabular data (lead lists, campaign metrics, analytics exports)
- Store all data files in the `data/` directory
- When generating reports, output to `data/` with a descriptive filename and date

## Code generation

- You may generate both typescript and python code
- Never write tests for code you generate
